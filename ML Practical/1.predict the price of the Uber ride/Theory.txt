Uber ride price prediction involves estimating the fare of a ride based on various factors like distance, time of day, traffic, weather, and surge pricing. Machine learning models are typically used to predict these prices by learning from historical data.

### Key Features:
- **Distance**: Longer trips usually have higher fares.
- **Time of Day**: Prices vary during peak hours due to increased demand.
- **Day of Week**: Weekends may see different pricing patterns.
- **Traffic & Weather**: Heavier traffic or adverse weather conditions can increase the fare.
- **Surge Pricing**: A multiplier applied during high demand times.

### Common Algorithms:
1. **Linear Regression**: Assumes a linear relationship between input features (like distance and time) and the output (price). It is simple and interpretable but may struggle with complex, non-linear data.
2. **Decision Trees**: This algorithm creates a tree structure where the data is split based on feature values to predict prices. Itâ€™s intuitive but can overfit on small datasets.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves prediction accuracy by averaging the results of multiple trees.
4. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Sequentially builds decision trees, each correcting the errors of the previous tree, achieving high accuracy but requiring careful tuning.

### Model Evaluation:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** are common metrics used to measure how well the model predicts fare prices.
- **Cross-validation** ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Regularization techniques like **Lasso** and **Ridge** prevent overfitting, while **hyperparameter tuning** optimizes model performance.
