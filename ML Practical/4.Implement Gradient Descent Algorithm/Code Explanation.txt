### Explanation of the Code:

This code demonstrates the **Gradient Descent** algorithm to minimize a simple quadratic function, \( f(x) = (x + 3)^2 \), and visualizes the process of finding the local minimum.

Let's break it down step by step:

---

### **1. Importing Libraries:**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- **`numpy`**: A library for numerical operations, used here for creating arrays and performing element-wise operations.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: A plotting library used for creating visualizations, like graphs and charts.

---

### **2. Defining the Function and Its Derivative:**

```python
def f(x):
    return (x + 3)**2
```
- **`f(x)`** is the function we want to minimize, which is a quadratic function. The minimum of this function occurs at \( x = -3 \).

```python
def df(x):
    return 2 * x + 6
```
- **`df(x)`** is the derivative (gradient) of the function \( f(x) \), which is used in the gradient descent algorithm to determine the direction of the update at each iteration.

---

### **3. Gradient Descent Algorithm:**

```python
def gradient_descent(initial_x, learning_rate, num_iterations):
    x = initial_x
    x_history = [x]
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        gradient = df(x)  # Calculate the gradient at the current point
        x = x - learning_rate * gradient  # Update x using the gradient and learning rate
        x_history.append(x)  # Store the updated value of x
    return x, x_history
```
- **`gradient_descent()`** is the function that implements the gradient descent algorithm:
  - **`initial_x`**: The starting point of the search for the minimum.
  - **`learning_rate`**: The step size used to update `x` at each iteration. A smaller learning rate means smaller steps.
  - **`num_iterations`**: The number of iterations the algorithm will run.
  - **`x_history`**: A list used to track the value of `x` at each iteration.
  - The algorithm repeatedly:
    1. Calculates the gradient (derivative) at the current point \( x \).
    2. Updates the value of \( x \) by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient (to minimize the function).
    3. The process is repeated for a specified number of iterations.

---

### **4. Setting Initial Parameters and Running Gradient Descent:**

```python
initial_x = 2
learning_rate = 0.1
num_iterations = 50
x, x_history = gradient_descent(initial_x, learning_rate, num_iterations)
print("Local minimum: {:.2f}".format(x))
```
- **`initial_x = 2`**: The algorithm starts from \( x = 2 \).
- **`learning_rate = 0.1`**: The learning rate is set to 0.1.
- **`num_iterations = 50`**: The gradient descent will run for 50 iterations.
- The result `x` is the local minimum found, and `x_history` contains the values of \( x \) at each iteration.

---

### **5. Visualization of Gradient Descent Process:**

```python
x_vals = np.linspace(-1, 5, 100)
```
- **`x_vals`** creates an array of 100 points between -1 and 5. This is used to plot the function \( f(x) \) over this range.

```python
plt.plot(x_vals, f(x_vals))
```
- This line plots the function \( f(x) = (x + 3)^2 \) over the range of \( x \).

```python
plt.plot(x_history, f(np.array(x_history)), 'rx')
```
- This plots the values of \( f(x) \) at each step of the gradient descent, showing the path taken by the algorithm to reach the local minimum. The `'rx'` argument makes the points red and marked with 'x'.

```python
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('f(x)')
plt.title('Gradient Descent')
```
- **`xlabel`** and **`ylabel`** add labels to the axes.
- **`title`** adds a title to the graph.

```python
plt.show()
```
- **`show()`** displays the plot.

---

### **Output:**
- The **final output** prints the value of `x` that corresponds to the local minimum found by the gradient descent algorithm.
- The plot shows:
  - The quadratic function \( f(x) = (x + 3)^2 \) as a smooth curve.
  - The red 'x' markers along the curve showing how gradient descent iteratively moves towards the minimum at \( x = -3 \).

---

### **Key Insights:**
- Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that adjusts the value of \( x \) to find the local minimum of a function by taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (slope) of the function.
- The **learning rate** plays a key role in determining the size of the steps taken in each iteration. Too large a learning rate might cause overshooting, and too small might slow down the convergence.
