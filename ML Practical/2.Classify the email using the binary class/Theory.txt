**Classifying Emails Using Binary Classification** involves determining whether an email is **spam (1)** or **not spam (0)** using machine learning techniques. Hereâ€™s a concise explanation:

### 1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Text Features**: Extracted from email content using techniques like **Bag of Words (BoW)** or **TF-IDF**, which convert text into numerical values.
   - **Metadata**: Includes sender details, keywords, and email attributes like attachments.

### 2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Cleaning**: Remove punctuation, stop words, and irrelevant characters.
   - **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words or tokens.
   - **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base forms for consistency.

### 3. **Common Algorithms**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: Simple, interpretable model predicting spam based on the probability.
   - **Naive Bayes**: Fast, effective for text classification using probability theory.
   - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Finds the best boundary between spam and not spam.
   - **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging multiple tree outputs.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
   - **Precision**: Focuses on avoiding false positives (wrongly marking non-spam as spam).
   - **Recall**: Focuses on identifying all spam emails.
   - **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Breaks down true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

This provides a compact view of the process, focusing on key steps and methods involved in binary email classification.
