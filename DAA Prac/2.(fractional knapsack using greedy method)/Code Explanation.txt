Let's go through the code step by step to explain its functionality in detail.

### **1. `fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity)`**

```python
def fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity):
    items = sorted(zip(value, weight), key=lambda x: x[0] / x[1], reverse=True)
    total_value = 0

    for v, w in items:
        if capacity >= w:
            total_value += v
            capacity -= w
        else:
            total_value += v * (capacity / w)
            break

    return total_value
```

- **Line 1**: Defines the function `fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity)` to solve the fractional knapsack problem. 
  - The inputs are:
    - `value`: List of values of items.
    - `weight`: List of weights of items.
    - `capacity`: The total weight capacity of the knapsack.
  
- **Line 2**: `items = sorted(zip(value, weight), key=lambda x: x[0] / x[1], reverse=True)`:
  - This line combines the `value` and `weight` lists into a list of tuples using `zip(value, weight)`. Each tuple contains the value and weight of an item.
  - The `sorted()` function is used to sort the items based on their **value-to-weight ratio** (i.e., `x[0] / x[1]`), in descending order (`reverse=True`).
  - The lambda function `lambda x: x[0] / x[1]` is used to calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item.
  
- **Line 3**: `total_value = 0`:
  - Initializes a variable `total_value` to keep track of the total value that can be carried in the knapsack.
  
- **Line 4-7**: A for loop iterates over each item in `items` (which is a sorted list of value and weight tuples).
  - **Line 5-6**: `if capacity >= w:`
    - If the current item’s weight (`w`) is less than or equal to the remaining capacity (`capacity`) of the knapsack, the whole item is added to the knapsack. The value `v` is added to `total_value`, and the knapsack capacity is reduced by the weight of the item (`capacity -= w`).
    
  - **Line 7**: `else:`
    - If the current item’s weight is greater than the remaining capacity, only a fraction of the item is added to the knapsack. The fraction of the item’s value added is proportional to the fraction of the remaining capacity, calculated as `v * (capacity / w)`. The loop then breaks because the knapsack is full.

- **Line 8**: `return total_value`:
  - After processing all the items (or filling the knapsack), the function returns the total value that can be carried in the knapsack.

### **2. `get_input()`**

```python
def get_input():
    value = list(map(int, input("Enter the values (comma-separated): ").split(',')))
    weight = list(map(int, input("Enter the weights (comma-separated): ").split(',')))
    capacity = int(input("Enter the capacity of the knapsack: "))

    return value, weight, capacity
```

- **Line 1**: Defines the `get_input()` function, which prompts the user for input and returns the values, weights, and capacity for the knapsack problem.
  
- **Line 2**: `value = list(map(int, input("Enter the values (comma-separated): ").split(',')))`:
  - This line prompts the user to input the values of the items as a comma-separated string.
  - `input()` takes the user input as a string.
  - `.split(',')` splits the input string into a list of substrings using the comma as the separator.
  - `map(int, ...)` converts each substring into an integer.
  - `list()` converts the map object into a list.
  
- **Line 3**: `weight = list(map(int, input("Enter the weights (comma-separated): ").split(',')))`:
  - Similar to the `value` list, this line prompts the user to enter the weights of the items and processes them into a list of integers.
  
- **Line 4**: `capacity = int(input("Enter the capacity of the knapsack: "))`:
  - This line prompts the user to input the knapsack's capacity and converts the input into an integer.
  
- **Line 5**: `return value, weight, capacity`:
  - The function returns the `value` list, the `weight` list, and the `capacity` value.

### **3. Main Program Execution**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    value, weight, capacity = get_input()
    result = fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity)
    print(f"Maximum value in knapsack: {result}")
```

- **Line 1**: `if __name__ == "__main__":`:
  - This condition ensures that the following block of code runs only when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).
  
- **Line 2**: `value, weight, capacity = get_input()`:
  - Calls the `get_input()` function to get the values, weights, and knapsack capacity from the user.
  
- **Line 3**: `result = fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity)`:
  - Calls the `fractional_knapsack()` function with the user-provided values, weights, and capacity to calculate the maximum value the knapsack can carry.
  
- **Line 4**: `print(f"Maximum value in knapsack: {result}")`:
  - Prints the result returned by the `fractional_knapsack()` function, which is the maximum value that can be accommodated in the knapsack.

### **Example Execution:**

If you input the following:
- Values: `60, 100, 120`
- Weights: `10, 20, 30`
- Knapsack Capacity: `50`

The output would be:

```
Enter the values (comma-separated): 60,100,120
Enter the weights (comma-separated): 10,20,30
Enter the capacity of the knapsack: 50
Maximum value in knapsack: 240.0
```

### **Explanation of Example:**

- The value-to-weight ratios for the items are:
  - Item 1: 60 / 10 = 6.0
  - Item 2: 100 / 20 = 5.0
  - Item 3: 120 / 30 = 4.0

- The items are sorted in descending order by their value-to-weight ratio:
  - Item 1, Item 2, Item 3.

- The knapsack capacity is 50:
  - Add Item 1 fully (weight 10, value 60, remaining capacity 40).
  - Add Item 2 fully (weight 20, value 100, remaining capacity 20).
  - Add Item 3 partially (weight 20 remaining, value 120, so we take a fraction, 20 / 30 * 120 = 80).

- The total value = 60 + 100 + 80 = 240.
